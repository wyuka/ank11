<h2 class="cufon1">The Vision</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>"pleasure of science lies not in discovering
the truth, but in seeking it"</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Ank, the first attempt by Maths 'N' Tech Club to conduct
a Knowledge fest of NIT Durgapur, evolved out of a whim of
the organizers to tease your gray cells and to establish
once and for all that mathematics is fun. The intent was to
infuse some frivolity in the largely mundane odd semester,
and feed the want of knowledge in a grossly competitive
premise, where students can come to enhance aptitude and
gain skills while having a gala time of it all. Ank has
consequently been conceptualized with events precisely
engineered to this effect.

<p>
At Ank '10, a host of hands-on workshops like
Ethical Hacking Workshop and Photoshop Workshop emphasized
skill and broadened the horizons of understanding of the youth,
while the “Maths-is-Fun” part included veritably innovative
events like Maths Maze &amp; Masti , Who&sq;s Next, Constructo,
and Terrorist Takedown. Alongside, a host of technology-based
events like Simplex, Kryptic, Picturesque, Images and Words
were thrown in to let loose the tech maniacs in every engineer.
In consequence, Ank 10 was a huge success, in terms of
participation as well as response – with a huge number of people
actively taking part in all the events right through all three
days. Now, we again venture forward with a bolstered spirit,
an unquenched enthusiasm with goals at the horizon to make a
resplendently exalting and energized quest of knowledge out
of Ank '11.
